for some reason score isn't saving.

Stuff to do:
* FIX MUSIC
* SPLIT UP FILES

fix the letting hit straight away problem.
sometimes casuses a gamestopping error when you run down to your 0 life.

mod score so hiding in corners gives 0 pts. middle gives many, and is judged by the frame, not by the second.

mod slow timekeeper. m/s not s. and also make graphical stretch bar instead of text.
&& mod invul timer to second/1000
